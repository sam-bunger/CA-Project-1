PART A: Explanations to questions 1-15

~~~~~~~~Question 1~~~~~~~~
This method will return 1 if the inputted integer is 0, and return 0 otherwise.

The method first, takes the compliment of the bits, adds 1, and sets it equal to y.
(it turns the value of x negative in 2's compliment)
0 in binary has the unique property of remaining exactly the same when negated in 2's compliment. So 0 will remain as all 0s
Any other number will be changed.
The next function takes the bitwise OR of x and y and then takes the compliment.
In the case of 0, the result will be all 1s. In the case of any other number, the leftmost bit will be 0. This is because, if the leftmost bit of x is 0, then the leftmost bit of y is one, and the bitwise OR output would be 1, once the compliment is taken, the leftmost bit will be 0.
This remains true when x is 1 as well.
So we know after the first two lines that:
-The leftmost bit when x=0 is 1
-The leftmost bit when x=any other number is 0
The next line shifts the leftmost-bit all the way until it is the rightmost bit, and fills the rest of the space with 0s and sets it to z
The bitwise AND of Z and 1 is taken.
All the bits left of the rightmost bit will become 0, because they are all zero in the case of binary 1 and z
In the case when x is:
0 - the function will return 1, because the rightmost bit for both z and binary 1 are 1.
any other number - will return 0 since the rightmost bit of z is 0.

~~~~~~~~Question 2~~~~~~~~
This method will return the absolute value of x.
It first makes the leftmost bit of x, containing the sign, and makes it the rightmost bit, and fills the rest with 0.
If x was positive, the result of the second line will not change x.
If x was negative, it will return the same value, except change the rightmost to a 0 or 1 depending on the number.
Next, if x was positive, then z will become all 0s since taking the complement of 0 and adding one will give you 0
if x was negative, you will get all ones because when the complement of the mask is taken, everything will become 1 except for the rightmost bit,
when 1 is added, all the bits in z will then become 1.
Adding y and z will give you y if x was positive,
if it was negative it will give you the absolute value of c because adding a number of all 1s and to y will flip the bits and shift the 1s to the left 1,
giving you a positive value.
~~~~~~~~Question 3~~~~~~~~
This method returns 1 if x is greater than 0, and returns 0 otherwise.
On the first line, y becomes 1 if x is 0, and becomes 0 otherwise.
On the second line, z becomes 1 if the leftmost bit, indicating the sign of x, is 1, and 0 otherwise.
The next line takes the bitwise or of x and y. The result will be 1 if x is either 0 or negative, and will be 1 otherwise.
The last line, returns the 1 if z was 0, or 0 if z was 1. So if x was greater than 0, 1 is returns, and if its less than 1, 0 is returned.
